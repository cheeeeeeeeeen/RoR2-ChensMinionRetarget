# Chen's Minion Retarget

## Description

Assign a priority target for your minions by pinging enemies. They will only acknowledge this command from their owner/master.

Take note that assigning a priority target for minions **does not force them to switch** targets. They will efficiently only attack the priority target **when in range of their attack** and **if it is in their line of sight**. They will also **ignore enemies that are attacking them** if the priority target is within their sights.

## Installation

Use **r2modman** mod manager to install this mod.
